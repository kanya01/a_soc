# This model initially had no columns defined. If you add columns to the
# model remove the "{}" from the fixture names and add the columns immediately
# below each fixture, per the syntax in the comments below

one:
  email: user1@example.com
  username: user1
  encrypted_password: <%= User.new.send(:password_digest, 'password123') %>

two:
  email: user2@example.com
  username: user2
  encrypted_password: <%= User.new.send(:password_digest, 'password123') %>
# column: value
